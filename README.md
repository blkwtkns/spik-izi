## Portal for accessing linguistic data, easy. 

## This project is born from frustration with online linguistic tools, most of which are proprietary or outdated. I'm first building a prototype site that hopefully is fun for learners of linguistics, but the aim is to make an easy API for linguists out there who want easy access to linguistic tools and visualizers.  

## So far it's a bit meager, but after the design looks a little better, I'll begin work on a morpho-syntactic visualizer. If you're interested in please contact me. 

## Issue: currently using wordsAPI for phonetic data. I'm looking for a phonetic dictionary for my node environment.
